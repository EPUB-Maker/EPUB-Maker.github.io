#### What is Resource Lock?

Once you insert your resource into article or as the cover images, it will be locked. You can not delete the locked resources until you unlock it.

#### How to unlock the Resource?

1. Make sure to remove the resource from all the articles and no reference on it.
2. Click `Refresh Lock` it will be done in backend and release the lock resource.
3. If your resource is still locked, you have to double-check in all the articles and EPUB Properties' cover image.

Note: `Insert Resources` is still under testing. When you insert media resources into articles, some issues may occur. â–
