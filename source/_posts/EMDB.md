EMDB is a data structure of EPUBMaker. It can be read as a JSON file.

EMDB contains only book properties, chapters, and articles. Resources will be stored on its path. If you open your EMDB in different systems, resources will be unable to be found.

You can create it by `File` -> `Save` a new file and read it through `File` ->`Open`. 

It's not recommended to modify it. â–
