`Chapter` -> `Delete Chapter` can delete the chapter you selected.

**Note: Delete a chapter will not delete its children chapters**

For example: 

```
Level 1-1
-- Level 2-1
---- Level 3-1
-- Level 2-2
```

If you delete `Level 2-1`, the chapter list will be:

```
Level 1-1
-- Level 3-1
-- Level 2-2
```

Its children will up their chapter level.

#### How to choose multiple selections?

You could use `Ctl` or  `Alt` to help your selection. 

When you first choose one chapter, and  `Ctl ` + Click another Chapter, both of them will be chosen. If you do the same operation with `Alt`, it will choose all the chapters between the first chosen chapter and the second chosen chapter.

#### Use `Del` to `Delete Chapter`

You could use `Del` in your keyboard to `Delete Chapter`, it will be the same operation as you click `Chapter` -> `Delete Chapter `. â–
