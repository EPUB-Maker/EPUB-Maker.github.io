When you `New` a new book or `Import TXT`, it will create a new chapter named "New Chapter" and a new article with nothing. The book properties will also be set a default value:

- Book Name: Book
- Author: Author
- Description: Description
- Languages: English
- EPUB version: 3.0
- Unique Identifier Key: uid
- Unique Identifier Value: (generated by random, not recommended to modify it)

If you `Import EPUB` , EPUBMaker will set the EPUB properties to the EPUB's you provided(if exist). What should be noticed is that EPUBMaker will only set the EPUB properties in the first `Import EPUB` . If you already have a workspace, it will never overwrite the EPUB properties. â–
