When your EPUBMaker is going crash, not responding or not working. Please tell us about these issues. It's better for you not only describe the issues in the text but also in **screenshots** or **EMDB files** / **TXT files** / **EPUB files** or any other files related to explain these issues.

We would also welcome the **logs** from EPUBMaker. You can find it in:

`C:\Users\${Users}\AppData\Roaming\epubmaker\log.log`

We would appreciate each of your feedbacks and suggestions.

Thank you very much for your help! â–
