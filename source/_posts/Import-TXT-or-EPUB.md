`Import TXT` will first create a chapter and import all the lines in this chapter. If the lines are over 1000, you're unable to edit the chapter. (For Detail, please go to [Editable](#Editable))

`Import EPUB` will keep the EPUB's chapter structure and convert the HTML pages into the EPUBMaker's articles. It will also extract the resources(images, audios or videos) to the path:

`C:\Users\${Users}\AppData\Roaming\epubmaker\epubmaker-resource\${timestamp}`

EPUBMaker has a fast speed to process big data files. You can transfer your TXT over 2MB or EPUB over 20MB(It may take a little more time to convert). â–
