![](/images/concepts-editable-1.png)

The editor has 3 different status:

- Editable
- Readable
- Empty

If you choose none of the chapters or even not create a workspace in EPUBMaker, it will show `Empty`. In this status, you are unable to edit anything.

`Editable` is the most common status in EPUBMaker. In this status, you could edit the article.

`Readable` is a for the articles which lines are over **1000**. Because it's hard to edit the articles over 1000 lines. In this status, you could only read the article. If you want to edit it, you could split the chapter first. â–
