`Chapter` -> `Split Chapter` is a useful function that helps you split the long text faster and easier.

There are two ways to split chapter in EPUBMaker, split by patterns and split by lines.

You could get more information about [Match Patterns](#Match-Patterns). And we are strongly recommendation to use it.

But if you are unable to match the patterns, you can also split by lines. â–
